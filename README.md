Mockito with Junit Sample Code

# What is Mocking? #
    Mocking is creating objects that simulates the behaviour of the real object
    Unlike stub, mocking can be dynamically created from code - at runtime
    Mocks offer more functionality than stubs
    You can verify method calls and a lot of other things
  
# Stubs are difficult to maintain #
    If we want to add dynamic condition then we need to keep adding new code
    If a new Service is added to the implementation class we need to implement the new method added
