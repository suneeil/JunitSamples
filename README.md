Mockito with Junit Sample Code

__ What is Mocking? __
   mocking is creating objects that simulates the behaviour of the real object
   Unlike stub, mocking can be dynimically created from code - at runtime
   Mocks offer more functionality than stubs
   You can verify method calls and a lot of other things
  
__ Stubs are difficult to maintain __
    If we want to add dynamic condition then we need to keep adding new code
    If a new Service is added to the implementation class we need to implement the new method added
